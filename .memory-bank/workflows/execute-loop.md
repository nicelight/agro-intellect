description: Workflow: PRD → FT → TASK loop (interactive or autonomous).

# Execute loop (PRD → Feature → Tasks)

## Principle: no task explosion
- `/prd` creates L1–L3 only (product/requirements/epics/features/testing/index).
- `/write-prd` = PRD-level ambiguity closure. `/clarify-feature` = optional feature-level ambiguity pass.
- `/spec-init` creates lightweight pre-PRD framing state in `.memory-bank/spec-backbone.md` after `/write-prd` and before `/prd`, while `.memory-bank/spec-index.md` remains a pure spec registry/index.
- `/spec-design` is mandatory after `/prd`; it records a minimal backbone for local/simple feature-set pressure or a full architecture scaffold for shared-boundary, contract, state/data/runtime/security, or strict pressure, and records `.memory-bank/foundation.md` when a Foundation Dev Path is needed.
- `/foundation-to-tasks` creates normal `FT-000` foundation JSON tasks and the final foundation gate when foundation is required; execute/verify that queue before product feature tasking.
- `/prd-to-tasks FT-<NNN>` performs full feature-level SDD design before task slicing, then creates the implementation plan, JSON task records, and required initial Execution Packets.
- Standalone `/spec-improve FT-<NNN>` and `/mb-packet TASK-NNN-TN-FT-NNN-WN` remain repair/advanced commands when design or packets must be refreshed outside the happy path.
- After the current feature task set is decomposed, run
  `/review-tasks-plan FT-<NNN>` in a fresh-context reviewer / separate fresh
  session. Then run `/mb-doctor` at the feature/task-queue boundary when the
  queue has T3 work, autonomous/autopilot handoff, or complex
  T2/foundation/dependency/packet/stale-doc/risky-link conditions. Simple manual
  T0/T1 queues do not require `/mb-doctor` by default.

## Interactive mode (you stay)
1) `/analysis -> /brief` when idea discovery is needed; use `/brainstorm` before `/brief` only for raw ideas
2) `/constitution` for contextual governing principles when `.memory-bank/constitution.md` is missing or `project_principles` is framework-default|skipped|missing; if principles are already ratified/partial, continue to `/write-prd`; if explicitly skipped, continue with framework-default/skipped principles
3) `/write-prd` (creates clarified .memory-bank/prd.md)
4) `/spec-init` (updates .memory-bank/spec-backbone.md framing and .memory-bank/spec-index.md registry)
5) `/prd` (fills L1–L3)
6) `/spec-design` (mandatory; minimal is valid for local/simple feature-set pressure)
7) If foundation is required, run `/foundation-to-tasks`, `/mb-doctor`, then execute/verify `FT-000` tasks until the final foundation gate is `done`
8) Pick one top feature; use `/clarify-feature FT-001` only for explicit feature blockers
9) `/prd-to-tasks FT-001` (completes feature-level SDD design, creates IMPL plan + `TASK-NNN-TN-FT-NNN-WN` records + required packets for this feature)
10) Run `/review-tasks-plan FT-001`, then run `/mb-doctor` at the
feature/task-queue boundary only when T3, autonomous/autopilot handoff, or
complex T2/foundation/dependency/packet/stale-doc/risky-link conditions apply;
use `/mb-doctor --strict` before autonomous handoff
11) Execute tasks from `.memory-bank/tasks/index.json` and indexed `*.task.json` records one-by-one:
   - T0/T1 manual: `/execute TASK`, compact evidence or no-runnable-check note, optional local closure by explicit owner
   - T2 manual: `/execute TASK -> /verify TASK`; sync at wave/feature boundary unless broader state must be reconciled earlier
   - T3 manual: `/execute TASK -> /verify TASK -> /red-verify TASK -> /mb-sync`
   - after all tasks for a T2 feature are implemented, run `/red-verify --feature FT-<ID>` before treating the feature as complete
   - start `/execute` only after the current feature task set has been decomposed and any required/conditional feature/task-queue doctor gate has passed
   - `/execute` reads packet/spec context only when required by tier/policy or linked by the task/feature; structural packet readiness is owned by `/mb-doctor`, not by the implementer
12) After each wave: `/review-tasks-plan FT-<NNN>` for the current or affected
feature, using a fresh-context reviewer / separate fresh session

## Autonomous end-to-end mode (start and leave)
1) `/autonomous`
2) command runs `/write-prd -> /spec-auto --init -> /prd -> /review-feat-plan -> /spec-design --all -> /foundation-to-tasks when required -> /mb-doctor --strict at foundation/task-queue boundary -> execute/verify FT-000 until the final foundation gate is done -> /spec-auto --all -> /prd-to-tasks --all -> /review-tasks-plan FT-<NNN> for each task-linked product feature`, then schedules ready TASKs
3) run `/mb-doctor --strict` again before product scheduler execution; T2/T3 tasks without SDD spec links are blockers
4) before `/execute`, scheduler checks required packets for every T2/T3 task and explicit T0/T1 packet requirement; missing/blocked/stale/invalid packets stop execution and require `/mb-packet TASK-NNN-TN-FT-NNN-WN` or blocker resolution
5) each TASK runs in **fresh CLI sessions**
6) after each `/mb-sync`, run `/mb-doctor --strict` before promoting dependents
7) after each wave: `/review-tasks-plan FT-<NNN>` for affected product features,
or every task-linked product feature if affected-feature scope is ambiguous
8) final success only if every task-linked product feature has latest
`/review-tasks-plan FT-<NNN>` = `APPROVE`, `/mb-doctor --strict` passes, and no
blocking tasks remain

## Autonomous executor only
If JSON task records already exist and `/review-tasks-plan FT-<NNN>` already
approved every task-linked product feature, use:
- `/autopilot`

`/autopilot` must run `/mb-doctor --strict` before each task selection pass and after each `/mb-sync` before promotion.

## Parallel vs sequential
- Independent tasks (no shared files) MAY run in parallel (separate sessions).
- Dependent or shared-file tasks MUST run sequentially: TASK-A (execute→tier-appropriate verify when required→red-verify if required by tier→mb-sync when boundary sync is required) → TASK-B.
